                    Get used to coding for mobile first.<br><br>
                    Brief<br><br>

                    Build an HTML website for a company called 'Re-cycle' that offer eco-friendly, guided cycling tours
                    of a town. Because their clients are travelling, it is very important that the website is mobile
                    responsive.
                    It should have 4 pages: home page, about us, contact us, and the list of routes/tours. Do not use
                    Bootstrap or another similar framework - we want to see your ability to create responsive layouts
                    using CSS.</p>

                <p>Building a mother`s day campain for UNICEF</p>
                <p><a href="http://camilla-reppen.com/reppen/UNICEF/index.html">UNICEF</a> </p>
                <p>Requirements <br><br>
                    Build a UNICEF Mother's Day marketing campaign website.<br>
                    The main purpose of this website is to highlight the four mothers day products on sale and
                    to ensure users click to an external e-commerce website where the user will be able to buy the
                    products (link to e-commerce website will be provided).
                    The website should have a: <br><br>
                    Homepage<br><br>
                    The Homepage should showcase all the products in a way that entices users to buy the product.
                    Each product should have a photo of product and a clear call to action to buy the product, onClick
                    it should take the user to the product detail page.<br><br>
                    Product detail page for each product.<br><br>
                    The product detail page should have a product description and photograph and link to the external
                    e-commerce website
                    The website must have a design that appeals to the target audience and is accordance with the brand
                    guidelines.
                    Compositional principles, typography, and color schemes must be considered.<br><br>
                    A project work plan, including a Gantt chart, should be included.<br><br>
                    Your HTML should be semantic and neatly indented.
                    The site should use external CSS style sheets.
                    The site should download quickly, and not be overly "heavy". Images should not be over 200kb.
                    The site should take WCAG principles into consideration, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation,
                    and color usage.
                    The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on a variety of devices.
                    The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider your use of meta tags and
                    alt text).
                    A report, documenting the entire project, must be included with the project delivery. Ensure the
                    report is a PDF and follows the correct naming conventions.
                    Pencil sketches, mood boards, and resources must be included in the report.
