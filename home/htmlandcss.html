                                    Your task is to recreate the nine Gestalt principles you learned about in today's lesson in small illustrations. 
                                    The principles are figure/ground, proximity, common fate, continuation, similarity, pragnanz, closure, symmetry, and regularity. 
                                    Try to come up with new ideas and ways on how to visualize these principles. 
                                    You should focus on form and use just black or gray colors. Do not use any other colors and keep it simple!</p>

                                    Icons are an essential part of user interfaces and helps to visually express actions and messages. 
                                    Your task is to create a collection of 6 icons for the webpage of a small local sushi restaurant. 
                                    You can choose the design, color and mood for the icons but remember that all the 6 icons will be used on the same webpage and should have the same visual style and language. 
                                    Icons should work well in any size so be cautious when using very small details in the icon design.</p>

                                                        Pseudo classes are used to reflect the state of an element. For

                                        Use Cascading Style Sheets to stylise 4 HTML web pages; use inline, internal,
                                        and external styles and identify the advantages and disadvantages of each
                                        approach.
                                        CSS allows us to meaningfully change the appearance of our HTML. Our aim is to
                                        keep the content and appearance as separate as possible. This approach has a
                                        number of advantages: it allows us to change the "look" of HTML content without
                                        having to change the content; it also allows for HTML text to be read by
                                        machines, and is generally considered best practice. </p>

                                        In this activity we are going to focus on the proper usage of tables, as well as
                                        how they may be styled using CSS. Tables are intended for the organization and
                                        display of data, but this does not mean they cannot be styled with CSS, just as
                                        any other HTML element. Styling may aid readability and comprehension of tabular
                                        data, as well as making it more aesthetically pleasing. We will have a brief but

                                        using pseudo-classes to aid readability and add interactivity to the table.</p>

                                <p>Goal<br><br>

                                        To learn and practice how to document your work process and write a project

                                        Documenting your work process can be a challenging exercise and writing a
                                        technical report is not the easiest task. Having some good routines and a clear
                                        idea on how to document and write your reports makes it easier. Of course, not
                                        all the projects will require documentation and report writing. But there will
                                        be some projects of a bigger scale as, for example, semester assignment where
                                        you will be enforced to write a report.</p>
