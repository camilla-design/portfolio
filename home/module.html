                                        A medium sized company - "Lofthus frukt og saft" located at Hardanger fjord in western Norway - are producing one of the best apple juices in Norway. It is a 100% pure natural product, without any sugar added or other additives of any kind.
                                        Until now they were mostly present at the local market in western Norway, but they have ambitions to expand and find new markets. As a part of this process they need a new website. The main purpose for the website will be to promote and sell their products. Also, information about the company and their production processes will be an important part of the website.</p>
